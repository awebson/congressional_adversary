    <h1>pretty please read the instructions </h1>

    <p>
        We are researchers from Brown University trying to help computers understand political euphemism!
        <!-- By completing these tasks, you are consenting to participation in our research. -->
        <!-- You may read the details
        <a target="_blank" href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/informed-consent.html" >here</a>. -->
        Please first complete the corresponding qualification task.
        If you pass, we will approve your qualification
        usually within 4 hours and no later than 12 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to convey an opinion or push an agenda,
        politicians from different parties often use very different words
        to refer to the same underlying policies or ideas, even though
        the sentiment, opinion, or connotation of those phrases
        might vary dramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be shown a series of phrase pairs. Please indicate on a 5-point scale
        <b>how much the phrases overlap in the underlying event or policy
        they refer to</b>.
        You should <b>ignore differences that stem from opinion or stance</b>,
        i.e. the way the speaker feels about the topic.
        Examples of each point on the scale are below.
    </p>

    <p>
        The examples are drawn from transcripts of congressional floor speeches
        from 1981 to 2011. They were automatically converted to digital form
        from paper transcripts. Consequently, phrases often are transcribed
        without spaces or punctuation, e.g. “cap-and-trade” may appear as
        “capandtrade”. We apologize for these errors.

    <p>
        We are interested in the meanings of these phrases from the perspective
        of a politically-informed citizen, not necessarily a professional.
        That is, if you are reasonably familiar with US politics,
        you should be able to make many judgments using your existing knowledge alone.
        However, <b>if you are unsure what a word or phrase means,
        please use the provided Google search links.</b>
        We don’t expect you to know every phrase.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are unable to make a decision after 30 seconds or so of Google searching,
        please indicate “unable to judge” and move on. You won’t be punished for
        choosing “unable to judge.” However, if you are choosing “unable to judge”
        for more than nearly half of the questions, please stop submitting tasks.
        If you submit a large number of HITs (e.g. >10) in which you are using
        the “cannot judge” option for more than ~40% of your responses,
        we may have to reject your subsequent HITs.
